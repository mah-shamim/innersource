## Managing Projects 

Repositories aren't just a place to upload code - they're a place to collaborate and work together. Depending on how you choose to manage projects, that process should be as transparent and integrated as possible. 

[Surveys show](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-3-most-effective-ways-to-build-trust-as-a-leader/) that trust not only is built by doing good - but by communicating the intent behind those actions. 

Being transparent is not a passive state, but an active effort to communicate your decisions and why you're making them. This relates to GitHub because it's where the work happens. How are issues triaged? Where should discussions happen? How are features implemented? These questions are important for you to answer for yourselves, and it's important to communicate the answers to everyone who will interact with your repository.
