## How to craft discoverable repos

For your repositories to flourish, it's important that people know they exist! Here are some tips for crafting discoverable repositories. 

### Repository purpose
- Make sure you solve a real problem. Repositories that have useful, helpful information will always rise to the top. 
- Make sure your idea behind the solution and your vision are clearly written down. It helps if people know not only what the repository is _for_, but where it came from and where it's going. 

### Sharing 
- Tell users to star your repo if they find it interesting.
- If you have a blog or mailing list, use it. Once your repository is ready, send an announcement your subscribers.
- Share it on relevant internal networks. Invite people to check out your website and GitHub repository.
- Reach out to others who keep interest in your work area and see if they can proactively communicate about your repo.
- Find some enthusiastic early adopters. 

### Repository content
- Add a short, but clear description of what the repository is for.
- Add other common README sections: contributing, build instructions, short usage example, etc.
- Add a screenshot of the program. Without a screenshot, visitors are more likely to leave the page.
- Create a demo page if possible, to help users get up and running as quickly as possible.
- Add a logo to the top of your README.
