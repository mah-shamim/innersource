## Measuring Success

It's important to think about what success means to you. Have clear goals before getting started, including a plan on how to measure. 

### Could you measure...
- Time to market
- Individual behaviors
- Bug fix pull requests
- Feature enhancement pull requests
- Number of outside collaborators 
- Number of clone or forks
- Progression of development languages
- Automation
- Submodule usage

### The bigger picture
Measuring success is about more than measuring certain data points. Measuring success is about setting goals,  checking in with the progress of those goals, and making adjustments where needed. **What are your Innersource goals?**
