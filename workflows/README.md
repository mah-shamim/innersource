## Workflows & Branching Strategies 

There's no one perfect workflow or branching strategy that fits every project. However, when you're collaborating in a repository on GitHub, it's important to have a clear workflow outlined and communicated. That way, contributors know what to expect and how to get things done. 

Here are a few of our favorite resources to help you make the right choice for your project: 
- [The GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
- [Azure's Guide to Branching Strategies](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/git-branching-guidance?view=azure-devops)
- A list of awesome [Contributing guides](https://github.com/mntnr/awesome-contributing) won't necessarily help you decide on a workflow, but it will help you decide how to communicate your chosen workflow
