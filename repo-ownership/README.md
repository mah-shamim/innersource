## Repository Ownership

Who should own a repository? Sometimes, it makes sense for an individual to own a **repository**. Other times, it makes sense for the repository to be owned by an **organization**.

While repository ownership is absolutely about permissions and control, it's also about visibility and discoverability. You can [manage permissions to a repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories) regardless of who owns it, but before creating all of your repositories under your own account, consider the benefits of having a more visible owner.
